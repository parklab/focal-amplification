# Mechanisms of Focal Amplifications in Breast Cancer Genomes

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of focal oncogene amplifications by analyzing the pattern of structural variations (SVs) at the boundary of amplicons. Step-by-step analysis procedures are described in <a href="https://github.com/parklab/focal-amplification/blob/main/Docs/workflow.md">Workflow</a>, and the associated scripts and small data files are deposited in this page.

The somatic variants of 780 breast cancer cases are available through the [Park Lab Website](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/TBAmplification/).
