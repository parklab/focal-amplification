<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Association amplificaiton boundaries (early events) with 3D chromatin interaction data</h2>
<p>To test if translocations connecting the amplicon boundaries were associated with chromatin proximity, we used a Hi-C dataset of T47D cells which do not have translocations between chromosomes of our interests (e.g., between chr11 and chr17).</p>
<p>XX function takes as chromatin contact matrix between two chromosomes processed by juicer and visualizeds as a heatmap (higher contact frequencies than expectations: red; lower: blue)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
