## Detection of focal amplifications

## SVs involving the boundaries of focal amplifications

## Association with epigenomics data
To determine which epigenomic features were most relevant to the initial events, we integrated the SV at focal amplification boundaries in breast cancer samples with several known chromatin features. XX function takes the coordinates of bindings for each factor and boundary positions in 10 kb bins as inputs and computed the enrichment p-values of the factor by Fisher's exact test.

XX<-function(){
}
