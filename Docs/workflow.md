## Detection of focal amplifications

## SVs involving the boundaries of focal amplifications

## Association with epigenomics data
To determine which epigenomic features were most associated with the initial SV events, we integrated the SVs at focal amplification boundaries in breast cancer samples with various chromatin features. XX function takes the coordinates of bindings for each factor and boundary positions in 10 kb bins as inputs and computed the enrichment p-values of the factor by Fisher's exact test.
